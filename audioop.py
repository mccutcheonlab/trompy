"""
Minimal shim for the stdlib `audioop` module to satisfy tests in this repo.

This is a small, test-friendly implementation placed in the repository root so
tests that do `from audioop import add` succeed in environments where the
extension module is not available. It is intentionally lightweight and does
not aim to be a full replacement for the real _audioop C-extension.

Only provides `add(fragment1, fragment2, width)` which will attempt to use
numpy for efficient array addition if available, otherwise falls back to
Python list/bytes handling. The `width` parameter is ignored in this stub.
